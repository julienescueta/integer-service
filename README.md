## About

This project uses [Feathers](http://feathersjs.com). An open source web framework for building modern real-time applications.

## Getting Started

Getting up and running is as easy as 1, 2, 3.

1. Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.
2. Install your dependencies

    ```
    cd path/to/integer-service; npm install
    ```

3. Start your app

    ```
    npm start
    ```

## Testing

Simply run `npm test` and all your tests in the `test/` directory will be run.

## Scaffolding

Feathers has a powerful command line interface. Here are a few things it can do:

```
$ npm install -g @feathersjs/cli          # Install Feathers CLI

$ feathers generate service               # Generate a new Service
$ feathers generate hook                  # Generate a new Hook
$ feathers help                           # Show all commands
```

## Notes

- Add a script to initialize `api` and `test` databases
- Email, password, api_key and identifier is limited to 255 characters
- Would like to clean-up data access layer so a single class provides all of the data store and retrieval.
